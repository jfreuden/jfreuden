## Hi there 👋

I'm Joshua Freudenhammer, a CMU Physics graduate, [hobby game dev](https://www.barbarossa-interactive.com), generalist techy, and lost wanderer

German-American currently living in the lovely Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany, near Kaiserslautern. 🇪🇺 🇩🇪

I also go by "rainybyte" like on my [BlueSky Profile](https://bsky.app/profile/rainybyte.bsky.social)

I'd love to chat about computer architecture, tech-art, competitive programming, physics, and all things STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics). Reach out with your favorite puns!
