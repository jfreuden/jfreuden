## Hi there 👋

I'm Joshua Freudenhammer, Founder of [Barbarossa Interactive](https://www.barbarossa-interactive.com), an Indie Studio working on a small casual to-be-announced game.

German-American living in the lovely Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany, near Kaiserslautern. 🇪🇺 🇩🇪

I also go by "rainybyte" like on my [BlueSky Profile](https://bsky.app/profile/rainybyte.bsky.social)

I'd love to chat about computer architecture, tech-art, competitive programming, physics, and all things STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics).
